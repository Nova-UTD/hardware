# Third-Scale Vehicle


## Drive-by-Wire Retrofit
### Force measurements
The following measurements were taken to determine design specifications for the motors used for steer and brake by-wire. These were performed with the incredibly sophisticated equipment of a luggage scale.
* 7kg measured to turn the steering wheel. Measured perpendicular to the radius of the steering wheel at a distance of 3in from the center. This results in (7kg)(9.8m/s/s)(0.08m) = (68.6N)(0.08m) = 5.5 Nm of torque.
* 35kg measured to rotate (apply) the brake. Measured at the small metal plate at a radius of 1.5in. This results in (35kg)(9.8m/s/s)(0.038m) = 13 Nm of torque.
* 14kg measured to rotate (apply) the brake. Measured on the metal tubing extending from the brake pedal, at a radius of 4in. This results in (14kg)(9.8m/s/s)(0.1m) = 13.7 Nm of torque.
Since the last two measurements corroborate each other, the torque specification for the motor for brake-by-wire is set to 14 Nm.
