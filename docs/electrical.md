## Subsystems

Hail-Bopp has two main power systems. The **48V system** is supplied by our Li-Ion traction batteries. This system then charges a  12V "auxiliary" SLA battery, which supplies our **12V system**.

The 48V system is currently only used to power the car's electric motor (and its directly related systems, such as the motor controller).

The 12V system powers everything else: headlights, the VCM, LiDAR pucks, and so on.
