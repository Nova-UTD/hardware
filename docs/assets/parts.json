    "purpose": "\"The motor controller receives a 48 VDC input and produces a variable AC output to drive the motor in turn propelling the vehicle. The motor controller controls direction and speed of the motor based on inputs from the drive mode switch and the pedal position sensor. The motor controller facilitates regeneration mode. When the accelerator pedal is released and the vehicle is slowing down, the motor generates power which is fed back in to the traction battery pack. The same motor controller is used with both the 5 kW and 6.5kW motors. When used with a 6.5 kW motor, a heat sink is installed which facilitates the dissipation of additional heat generated when controlling the larger motor (GEM 407)\".",
